I have written many things in here. This will describe the stereotypes of BYU. 

Return Missionary
-Too excited to date for his own good
-Corrects everyone on doctrine. 

Provo All-Star
-Too involved in the double V. (Vivint and Vasa)
-Spends too much time at the gym

Utah Valley Girl
-Needs to hear herself speak more often.
